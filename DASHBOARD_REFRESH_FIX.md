# Dashboard Refresh Fix ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Projects Not Appearing Immediately After Saving
**Problem**: When users saved a project in the editor and returned to the dashboard, the new/updated project would only appear after a manual page refresh or after some delay.

**Root Cause**: The dashboard wasn't reloading projects when the user returned from the editor page.

**Solution**: Added a `focus` event listener that automatically reloads projects when the dashboard page regains focus (when user switches back from editor).

### 2. Share Links Not Showing Immediately After Creation
**Problem**: After creating a shareable link and clicking "Done", the link preview wasn't showing in the dashboard until the page was manually refreshed.

**Root Cause**: The dashboard's links list wasn't being refreshed after a new link was created in the ShareLinkDialog.

**Solution**: 
- Added `reload` function to `useShareableLinks` hook
- Added `onSuccess` callback to `ShareLinkDialog` component
- Dashboard now passes `reloadLinks` as the `onSuccess` callback
- Links list refreshes immediately after successful link creation

## Files Modified

### 1. `hooks/use-shareable-links.ts`
**Change**: Exposed `reload` function in the return object
```typescript
return {
  links,
  loading,
  create,
  remove,
  update,
  checkSlugAvailability,
  getActiveCount,
  reload: loadLinks, // ✅ Added
}
```

### 2. `components/share-link-dialog.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added `onSuccess?: () => void` to `ShareLinkDialogProps` interface
- Added `onSuccess` to component props destructuring
- Call `onSuccess()` after successfully creating a link

```typescript
// In handleGenerateLink after success:
if (onSuccess) {
  onSuccess()
}
```

### 3. `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Extracted `reload` function from `useProjects()` hook
- Extracted `reload` function from `useShareableLinks()` hook
- Added `focus` event listener to reload both projects and links when page gains focus
- Pass `reloadLinks` as `onSuccess` callback to `ShareLinkDialog`

```typescript
// Get reload functions
const { projects, remove, reload: reloadProjects } = useProjects()
const { links: allLinks, reload: reloadLinks } = useShareableLinks()

// Auto-reload on focus
useEffect(() => {
  const handleFocus = () => {
    reloadProjects()
    reloadLinks()
  }
  
  window.addEventListener('focus', handleFocus)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('focus', handleFocus)
}, [reloadProjects, reloadLinks])

// Pass reload callback to dialog
<ShareLinkDialog
  project={selectedProject}
  open={shareDialogOpen}
  onOpenChange={setShareDialogOpen}
  onSuccess={reloadLinks} // ✅ Added
/>
```

## How It Works Now

### Project Refresh Flow:
1. User edits/creates project in editor
2. User saves project (stored in Supabase)
3. User clicks "Back to Dashboard" or switches browser tabs
4. Dashboard detects `focus` event
5. Dashboard automatically calls `reloadProjects()`
6. Projects list updates immediately ✅

### Share Link Refresh Flow:
1. User clicks "Share" on a project
2. User creates a shareable link in the dialog
3. Link is successfully created in Supabase
4. `ShareLinkDialog` calls `onSuccess()` callback
5. Dashboard's `reloadLinks()` function is triggered
6. Links list updates immediately ✅
7. User clicks "Done" and sees the new link in the dashboard

---

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Users see their changes instantly without manual refresh
✅ **Better UX**: No confusion about whether the action succeeded
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard always shows the latest data when user returns
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Backward compatible - `onSuccess` is optional

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create a new project in editor → Return to dashboard → Project appears immediately
- [x] Edit existing project → Return to dashboard → Changes appear immediately
- [x] Create shareable link → Click "Done" → Link appears in dashboard immediately
- [x] Switch between browser tabs → Dashboard refreshes automatically
- [x] Multiple users scenario → Changes sync when switching tabs

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Both issues resolved with automatic refresh functionality
