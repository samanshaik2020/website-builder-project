## Changes Made

- Added `<Toaster position="top-center" richColors />` component
- Enables toast notifications globally across the app

### 2. **Pricing Page** (`app/pricing/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Replaced: Plan upgrade success alert
- **New**: Success toast with description
- **Behavior**: Shows toast, waits 1 second, then redirects to dashboard

```typescript
toast.success(`Successfully upgraded to ${planId.toUpperCase()} plan!`, {
  description: "Your plan has been updated. Enjoy your new features!",
  duration: 4000,
})
```

### 3. **Editor Page** (`app/editor/page.tsx`)
Replaced 4 alerts:

#### a) Pro Template Limit Reached
```typescript
toast.error("Pro Template Limit Reached", {
  description: `You've reached your limit of ${limit} pro templates. Upgrade your plan to create more.`,
  duration: 5000,
})
```

#### b) Normal Template Limit Reached
```typescript
toast.error("Template Limit Reached", {
  description: `You've reached your limit of ${limit} normal templates. Upgrade your plan to create more.`,
  duration: 5000,
})
```

#### c) AI Generation Failed
```typescript
toast.error("AI Generation Failed", {
  description: "Failed to generate content. Please try again.",
  duration: 4000,
})
```

#### d) Save & Publish Success/Failure
```typescript
// Success
toast.success("Saved & Published!", {
  description: "Your project has been saved successfully. Check the Dashboard to see it.",
  duration: 4000,
})

// Error
toast.error("Failed to Save", {
  description: "Failed to save project. Please try again.",
  duration: 4000,
})
```

### 4. **Dashboard Page** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
Replaced 1 alert + added 1 new toast:

#### a) Export Feature Locked
```typescript
toast.error("Export Feature Locked", {
  description: "Export is only available on Professional and Unlimited plans. Upgrade to export your websites.",
  duration: 5000,
})
```

#### b) Export Success (NEW)
```typescript
toast.success("Export Successful!", {
  description: `${project.name} has been exported as HTML.`,
  duration: 3000,
})
```
