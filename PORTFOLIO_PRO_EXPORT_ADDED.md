# ✅ Portfolio Pro Export Added

## Problem Fixed
Portfolio Pro template had no export function - it would fall through to the generic export, resulting in a basic HTML file that didn't match the template.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Portfolio Pro to Export Switch** ✅
```typescript
case "portfolio-pro":
  html = generatePortfolioProHTML(getText, getImage, getButton, theme)
  break
```

### 2. **Created Export Function** ✅
Added `generatePortfolioProHTML()` function with:
- Theme support (reuses SaaS Pro theme system)
- Navigation with 5 menu items
- Hero section with greeting, title, subtitle, description, and portrait
- Featured Work section with 3 project cards
- Footer with copyright

### 3. **Theme Support** ✅
Portfolio Pro now exports with correct theme styling:
- Uses the same `getThemeStyles()` function as SaaS Pro
- Supports all 6 themes:
  - Modern Minimal
  - Corporate Blue
  - Vibrant Playful
  - Elegant Dark
  - Creative Bold
  - Nature Calm

## What Now Works

### ✅ Portfolio Pro Export
- Select Portfolio Pro template
- Choose any theme
- Edit content
- Save project
- Export HTML → Complete template with theme styling!

### ✅ Theme-Aware Export
Each Portfolio Pro theme exports with correct colors:
- **Creative Artist** → Pink/purple/orange colors
- **Tech Minimal** → Gray/blue minimal design
- **Luxury Elegant** → Black/gold sophisticated look
- **Nature Organic** → Green eco-friendly palette
- **Cyberpunk Futuristic** → Cyan/pink high-tech style

## Sections Included in Export

1. **Navigation Header**
   - Brand name
   - 5 navigation links (Work, About, Services, Blog, Contact)
   - Resume button
   - Hire Me CTA

2. **Hero Section**

   - Subtitle (role)

4. **Footer**

## Files Modified
