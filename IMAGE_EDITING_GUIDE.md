### Tips & Best Practices

üí° **Optimize Images Before Upload**
- Compress large images to reduce file size
- Recommended: 1920px width max for hero images
- Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh.app

üí° **Use High-Quality Images**
- Free sources: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay
- Ensure proper licensing for commercial use

üí° **Image URLs**
- Must be publicly accessible
- HTTPS URLs recommended
- Direct image links work best (ending in .jpg, .png, etc.)

üí° **Base64 Considerations**
- Uploaded images increase project size
- Good for small to medium images
- For large images, consider using URLs

### Troubleshooting

**Image not showing after upload?**
- Check file size (should be under 10MB)
- Ensure file is a valid image format
- Try using a URL instead

**Image URL not working?**
- Verify the URL is publicly accessible
- Check if URL is a direct image link
- Some sites block hotlinking - try downloading and uploading instead

**Image looks pixelated?**
- Upload a higher resolution image
- Ensure image dimensions match the display size

**Can't click on image?**
- Make sure you're in **Edit mode** (not Preview)
- Check that the template is loaded
- Try clicking directly on the image, not the border

### Where Images Are Saved

- **During Editing**: Images are stored in the DOM
- **After Save**: Images are saved as base64 in localStorage
- **After Export**: Images are embedded in the exported HTML file

### Export Behavior

When you export your project:
- **Uploaded images** (base64) are embedded in the HTML
- **URL images** remain as external links
- Both work perfectly in the exported file
